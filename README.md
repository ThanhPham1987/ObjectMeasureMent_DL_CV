# **Object Measurement using traditional and Deep learning (YoloV3)**

## **OBJECTIVE:**

1. The project's goal is to create an object measurement using traditional and deep learning approaches.


## **PROJECT Approaches**

1. Traditional Opencv Approach
   
   - Detect the object and measure height and width using opencv

3. Deep learning
   
- First detect object using yolov3 (coco dataset)
- Then find the height and width of the object
